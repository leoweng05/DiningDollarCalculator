This program checks how many dining dollars you should have approximately. It does account for Thanksgiving, winter break, and spring break but not any other holiday. It assumes you're in school for half of each finals week which is just an arbitrary standard I put. It is based off the 2023-2024 calendar but all you have to do to adjust it is change the variable dates at the top of the file.
